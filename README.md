### 🧠 About This Project

This is my **first cybersecurity blog**, where I explore how phishing attacks work, how attackers trick users, and how we can defend against them through awareness and careful observation.

I created a **simulated phishing email**, identified its red flags, and wrote a full awareness guide based on my learning.
